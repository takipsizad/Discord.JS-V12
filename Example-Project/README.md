# How Can I Start the Bot?
First, make sure that `Node.js` is installed. If it is not installed, download it. [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

If you ready, now let's go step by steps:

* Go inside the project and open the file `config/config.json` and adjust your settings. If you don't know how to set, check the [Bot Configuration](#-Bot-Configuration) section.
* Go to the project location and open a terminal.
  * If you cannot open it in the folder, open a normal terminal from your computer and type the command `cd path/to` in it.
* Type the command `npm start`, `node .` or `node index.js` into the terminal.
* Tada! Your bot is ready ðŸŽ‰
